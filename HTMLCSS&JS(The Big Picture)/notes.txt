History of the Web. 

1960 - Packet switching research - to create networks that could survice teh nukes. packet switching is data in message blocks that are routed seperately. 

late 1960's NPL / ARPANET first private networks. 

1972 - link between the US and Europe by satilite 

1981 - ARPANet expanded.

1981 - IP4 Published TCP/IP - started public availbility to the internet. (rudimentary)

1989 - World wide web proposed - open information system populated with documents you can get access to with urls. 

1990 - first browser using HTML documents. 

1994 - cascading HTML style sheets (CSS) intorduced

1995 - JS introduced - programable actions on the web. 

1999 - Internet on mobile phones. 

2000 - 414M internet users. 

2008 - Google Chrome. 

2017 - 3.9Bn people have internet access. / 47% of all webpage views from mobile devices. 



How the magic of the web works. 

The WWW is a information space, where documents and other web resources are identigied by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) interlinked by hypertext links and be accessed via the Internet. 

Ingredients for the Web : 
HTML Documents (images / documents / other documents)
URL (Uniform resource locators)
HTTP Hypertext transfer protocol - magic that can retrieve documents and communicate them to your browser. 

Ingredients for the Web. 

Documents (HTML) are hosted on a web server which will have a URL such as http://server.com/document.HTML
clients = web browsers desktops laptops / mobile phones / vr headsets. they ask the internet to serve up the document from a URL. HTTP does this serving. 
CSS & JS is used to style and give the document functionality. 

HTTP (GET & POST)


Why Learn about HTML, CSS & JS ? 

New to these topics learn about them to know what they are on a high level, when you know this you know why they are relevent for the web and software dev. 
How people use them. 
already expierenced is still useful as it reinforces and sharpes your understanding. 






Display the web with HTML. 
basics of HTML hypertext markup laungauge. 

Where did HTML come from ? 

HTML is the standard markup laungauge for creating web pages and web applications. 
you use it to control the presentation of data, its not a programmign laungauge. 

HTML started in 1990 v1.0. 
1993 first draft of HTML specification - actual standard to be used by all web browsers. 
1995 - HTML 2.0 
1997 - HTML 3.2
1997 - HTML 4.0 
1999 - HTML 4.01
2014 - HTML 5 - large number of new HTML elements for more expressive markup and interactive webpages. 
2016 - HTML 5.1
2017 - HTML 5.2

How manages the HTML specification ? 
1990 - Tim Berners Lee - first spec of HTML. 
1993 - Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - proposed first standard.
1996 - World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - Takes over founded by Tim Berners Lee
2000 - ISO / IEC - officially became standardized
2004 - Web HyperText Application technology working group (WHATWG) - working on HTML 5.0

HTML 5 is now a living standard, there may never be a HTML 6.0 as 5 will just be iterated on. 



What is HTML ? 

Structure of a HTML Document. .HTM / .HTML 
they contain various elements in the HTML spec. 

<!DOCTYPE html> - tells the browser the document is HTML. 
<html> - tells the browsers everything in this element is HTML. 
    <head> - contains meta information for the document. scripts and styles
    </head>
    <body> - the content of the page. 
    </body>
</html>


example of HTML. 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> 
    <head> 
        <meta charset="utf-8"> - tells the browsers the char encocding. 
        <title>My HTML Page !</title> - what appears at the top of the browser. 
    </head>
    <body> 
        <div> - indicated everything in this tag belongs together
            <ul> - UL list with 3 li items that contains text. 
                <li>This</li>
                <li>is an</li>
                <li>unordered list</li>
            </uk>
        </div>
    </body>
    
</html>

more expressive elements in HTML 5.0. 

<header> - represents container for introductry content or a nav bar can contain a nav tag. 

<main> - main content of a document. 
<article> - independent self ocntained content
<aside> - some content aside from the conent it is placed in. 
<footer> - contains things like copyright / company address. 

More interactive HTML Elements. 

<audio> - can use to display audio control bar. 

<canvas> - paint on 

<form> - basis for most ineractive websites or applications to post info from browser to the server. 

<input> elements such as buttons. 

<video> play vidoes in the browser

lots more of these exist. 


Browser support of HTML Elements. 

caniuse.com. 

HTML is markup laungage - not all web browsers support all elements. 




Working with HTML. 
Text Editors or IDE's use an IDE as they are good. 

htmllivecode.com - free editor on the web. - useful for trying stuff out. 

Write HTML with a framework 
you write code in a software laungage using a framework such as PHP 
framework will generate HTML to be sent to the client. 

Example of a Framework ASP.net MVC
create cshtml files (C#) in combines C(#) with HTML in the document. 

provides flexibility and features and is much more advanced. 

frameworks 
PHP - well known as used by wordpress.
Java - programming laungage with framworks for HTML. 
ASP.NET MVC
Ruby 
Python 
Node.JS
Go 

can create frameworks and applications from scratch and create HTMl for you. 




Styling with CSS. 
Code that tells the browser how to style the HTML. 

Where did CSS come from ?

}

#para1 {
    color: blue;
}

div p {

class has a higher priority than elements and ID has a higher priority than class. they overwrite eachother. 

!important has highest priority and will overwrite

if not overwritten it will use the highest value. 


Advanced CSS syntax. 

media querys. 

@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
    body {

    }
}

this would make the page responsive, enables a different feel and view depending on the screen size. 

gradient property 
#grad {
    background: linear-gradient(red, yellow);
}


Browser support for CSS Syntax. 

you can view it at caniuse.com 




Working with CSS. 

HTML and CSS needs to be linked and the CSS needs to be hosted on the Web Server. 

Web browser does all the work using the CSS file. 

CSS can be created from scratch using a text editor or a IDE (VS Code)

ide will help you autocomplete CSS, this is helpful to speed up development. 

CSS Libraries 
lots of these exist and most are opensource / free. 
Bootstrap was created by twitter
hamburgers.css 
font-Awesome
Ionic
Materialize 

all designed to make life easier for developers. 


using bootstrap. 

to link bootstrap link it in the HTML using the bootstrap url. no need to host it on your own web server. 

can then use classes to use the styles from the Bootsrap css library. 

bootstrap can save alot of time. 


CSS Preprocessors. 

framework / laun to create CSS files with. 

created becuase CSS is too simplistic and can create large CSS files. 

lots of CSS processors. 

LESS / SASS 

you write your stylecode in the preprocessor

compile it and you get the CSS.
can be useful to increase your producivity. 







JavaScript & Interacting with the Web. 
"The glue of the web"
used to make the web more interactive.

Where did JS come from ? 
JS is a high level interpreted programming language. 
JS is not Java !

1995 - First version of JavaScript
1995 - first server side implementation of JS. 
1996 - JS submitted to be standardized
1997 - ECMAScript 1
1998 - ECMAScript 2
1999 - ECMAScript 3
2000 - Work on ECMASCript 4
2004 - ECMASCript 4 scrapped. 
2007 - ECMAScript 3.1 started by message
2009 - ECMAScript 5
2011 - ECMAScript 5.1
2015 - ECMAScript 2015

JS Libraries
JQuery 
Dojo Toolkit
Prototype.JS
Boostrap

D3.js

can help selecting HTML elements, boostrap has Jquery plugins for animations and the like. 

these can speed up dev time.
